# Basic Linux Commands

Linux provides a powerful command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to interact with the operating system and perform a wide range of tasks. Learning some basic commands is essential for navigating the Linux environment. In this section, we'll introduce you to fundamental commands that every Linux user should know.

## 1. `pwd` - Print Working Directory

Use `pwd` to display the current directory (folder) you are in.

Example:
```bash
$ pwd
/home/username
```

## 2. `ls` - List Files and Directories

The `ls` command is used to list the files and directories in the current location.

Example:
```bash
$ ls
file1.txt file2.txt directory1 directory2
```

## 3. `cd` - Change Directory

With `cd`, you can change your working directory to another location.

Example:
```bash
$ cd /path/to/directory
```

## 4. `mkdir` - Make Directory

Create a new directory using `mkdir`.

Example:
```bash
$ mkdir new_directory
```

## 5. `touch` - Create Empty File

Create an empty file with `touch`.

Example:
```bash
$ touch new_file.txt
```

## 6. `cp` - Copy Files and Directories

The `cp` command is used for copying files and directories.

Example:
```bash
$ cp file1.txt /path/to/destination
```

## 7. `mv` - Move or Rename Files and Directories

Use `mv` to move or rename files and directories.

Example (move):
```bash
$ mv file1.txt /path/to/destination
```

Example (rename):
```bash
$ mv old_file.txt new_file.txt
```

## 8. `rm` - Remove Files and Directories

`rm` allows you to remove files and directories. Be cautious when using it, as it deletes without confirmation.

Example (remove a file):
```bash
$ rm file.txt
```

Example (remove a directory and its contents):
```bash
$ rm -r directory
```

## 9. `man` - Manual Pages

To access manual pages and get help on commands, use `man`.

Example:
```bash
$ man ls
```
# File Viewing and Editing

## 1. `cat` -  Concatenate and display the content of files.
Example:
```bash
$ cat
```

These are just a few of the essential Linux commands to get you started. Experiment with these commands, and over time, you'll become more comfortable with the Linux command-line interface. 

Remember that you can use the `man` command to access manual pages for any command to learn more about its options and usage.
